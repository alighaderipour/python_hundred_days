"""
1- Objects : 4, 5, [6, 7], 6, 7 ,"hi" , "hello", function definition, 2, 3 ,9  
(the list is a compound object since its made of some simple objects | "hello" string is also an object even tho we did not assign any identifier 
to it |function definitions are also object cause you need to memorise the rules in somewhere in temporary memory | 9 is also an object cause 
it's part of the memory|these are all objects because they 
occupy some space in memory ~> RAM so when C Python shell starts, these objects are 
being created in RAM)
                                        --> ALL OBJECTS HAVE A TYPE  <--
                                    --> OBJECTS ARE CREATED BY CLASSES <--
                                    
so when we say 5 is a class it's actually int(x=5) and it's from int class.
when we say [5, 6] is an object it's actually list(5, 6) and it's from list class.


2- Identifiers: a, b, c, d, area, x
(identifiers are names that we use to identify an object for example "human being" is an object and "Ali" is an identifier)

3- Operators : **

4- Delimiters: , " () : []
(https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#operators)

5- Keyword: def, return

6- Comments : # all language elements in this code

7- Blank Lines :

8- White Spaces:
