"""
n Python, accumulate is a function available in the itertools module. It allows you to generate accumulated results of applying a binary function (like addition, multiplication, etc.) to the elements of an iterable.

Explanation from Scratch:
What is accumulate?

accumulate takes an iterable (like a list) and applies a function cumulatively to its items. By default, the function used is addition, but you can specify any binary function (a function that takes two arguments).
How does it work?

It generates a running total (or other cumulative results) as you iterate over the elements. For example, if you're summing the elements, accumulate will output a sequence of sums.
Syntax:
python
Copy code
import itertools

itertools.accumulate(iterable, func=None)
iterable: The input iterable (e.g., a list).
func: A binary function that takes two arguments. If omitted, the default function used is addition (operator.add).
