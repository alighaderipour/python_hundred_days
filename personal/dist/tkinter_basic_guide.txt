To convert a Tkinter application into a standalone .exe file for Windows, you can use a tool like PyInstaller. PyInstaller bundles your Python application and all its dependencies into a single package, which can be distributed and run on any Windows system without requiring a separate Python installation.

Here are the steps to create an .exe file from your Tkinter application using PyInstaller:

Step 1: Install PyInstaller
First, you need to install PyInstaller. You can do this using pip:

bash
Copy code

pip install pyinstaller

Step 2: Create Your Tkinter Application
Ensure your Tkinter application code is saved in a file, for example, calculator.py.

Step 3: Use PyInstaller to Create the .exe File
Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where your calculator.py file is located, and run the following command:

bash
Copy code

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed calculator.py

--onefile: This option tells PyInstaller to bundle everything into a single executable file.
--windowed: This option tells PyInstaller to suppress the console window when running the GUI application.
Step 4: Locate the .exe File
After running the above command, PyInstaller will create several directories and files. The standalone .exe file will be located in the dist directory inside your project folder.
